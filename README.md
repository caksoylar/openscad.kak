# openscad.kak

**openscad.kak** is a plugin for the [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) editor.
It provides syntax highlighting for OpenSCAD files.

The syntax highlighting was quickly thrown together using snippets from the existing
highlighters shipped with kakoune.
There probably will be some stuff that does not work correctly right now, if you find
anything please create an issue and/or a pull request.

## Installation

Add this to your `kakrc`:
```kak
plug "mayjs/openscad.kak"
```
Restart Kakoune, and execute `:plug-install`.

### With NixOS

Add the following to your config:
```nix
environment.systemPackages = [
  (kakoune.override {
    plugins = with kakounePlugins; [ openscad-kak ];
  });
];
```
